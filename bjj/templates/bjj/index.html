<p>
Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) is a grappling-based martial art that focuses on ground fighting, submissions, and positional control. It evolved from traditional Japanese jiu-jitsu and judo and was developed in Brazil primarily by the Gracie family in the early 20th century.

Key Principles of BJJ:
Leverage Over Strength – Smaller practitioners can defeat larger opponents using technique.
Ground Control – Emphasis on takedowns, pins, and maintaining dominant positions like mount, back control, or side control.
Submissions – Chokes and joint locks (e.g., armbar, triangle choke, rear naked choke) are used to end matches or defend oneself.
Position Before Submission – Control your opponent before attempting a finish.
